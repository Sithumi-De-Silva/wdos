                <h4><u>Rampant poaching and over exploitation</u></h4>
                <p>Turtles are fighting for their survival and they are frequent victims of by-catch. Poaching has negative effects on 
                    nesting populations. Poaching incidents have been extensively reported in Souteast Asia. Sea turtles are under 
                    heavy exploitation measures since humans are harvesting their meat, shell and eggs.</p>
                   <p>The international union of conservation of nature has classified(<a href="http://www.iucn.org/">IUCN</a>) all seven turtle 
                    species ranging from vulnerable to critically endangered.</p>

                <h4><u>Climate Change</u></h4>  
                <p>The increasing global climate also has a negative effect on turtle species. Changing sand temperatures, sea level rise and 
                    stronger storms will erode and destroy their beach habitats. Warming oceans will change ocean currents, potentially
                introducing sea turtles to new predators.</p>
                <p>Some turtles need coral reefs to survive. Harming the coral reefs will make it impossible for them to survive.</p>
                <p>The temperature of the beach sand that the female sea turtle nest is influences the sex of their offspring during incubation.
                    Warming climate may be driving sea turtles into extinction by creating a shortage of males.  </p>

                <h4><u>Pollution</u></h4> 
                <p>Plastic, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products and other debris injure sea turtles through ingestion and 
                    entanglement. It weakens the turtle's immune system, disruput nesting behaviour and hatchling orientation. </p>
                <p>Chemicals contaminate the marine environment which accumulate in the tissues of sea turtles. It also affects their lomocation,
